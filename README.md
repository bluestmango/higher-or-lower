Simple higher or lower game, designed to be played with a deck of cards. For those unfamiliar, you flip up
the top card and guess whether the next one will be higher or lower than it

Script calculates the statistically best guess & optionally restarts after a wrong one.  
Haven't tested what happens if the deck runs out, probably nothing good. Will handle that in future if it's needed
